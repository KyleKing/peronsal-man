# Personal Style Guides

## Git

We use [Commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen-tools/commitizen) to manage both an auto-generated [Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) and incrementing the release version following [semver](https://semver.org/). For both of these automated outputs to work well, please follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) style, which is described in more detail below.

### Commitizen Types and Scopes

> `type(scope): description`

- **Types**
  - *fix*: A bug fix
  - *feat*: A new feature
  - *docs*: Documentation-only changes (code comments, separate docs)
  - *style*: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons)
  - *perf*: A code change that improves performance
  - *refactor*: A change to production code that is not a *fix*, *feat*, or *perf*
  - *test*: Adding missing or correcting existing tests
  - *build*: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
  - *ci*: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts
  - A `!` can be used to indicate a breaking change (`refactor!: drop support for Node 6`)
  - **SemVer Rules**
    - Based on commit type, the version will be auto-incremented: `fix : PATCH // feat : MINOR // BREAKING CHANGE : MAJOR`
- **Scopes**
  - A Class, File name, Issue Number, other appropriate noun. As examples: `build(poetry): bump requests to v3` or `style(#32): add missing type annotations`
- **Tips**
  - What if a commit fits multiple types?
    - Go back and make multiple commits whenever possible. Part of the benefit of Conventional Commits is the focus on more organized and intentional changes
  - Use `git rebase -i` to fix commit names prior to merging if incorrect types/scopes are used

### Git Description Guidelines

- [Commit message guidelines](https://writingfordevelopers.substack.com/p/how-to-write-a-commit-message)
  - Full sentence with verb (*lowercase*) and concise description. Below are modified examples for Conventional Commits
    - `fix(roles): bug in admin role permissions`
    - `feat(ui): implement new button design`
    - `build(pip): upgrade package to remove vulnerabilities`
    - `refactor: file structure to improve code readability`
    - `perf(cli): rewrite methods`
    - `feat(api): endpoints to implement new customer dashboard`
- [How to write a good commit message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)
  - A diff will tell you what changed, but only the commit message can properly tell you why.
  - Keep in mind: [This](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html) [has](https://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Distributed-Git-Contributing-to-a-Project#_commit_guidelines) [all](https://github.com/torvalds/subsurface-for-dirk/blob/master/README.md#contributing) [been](http://who-t.blogspot.co.at/2009/12/on-commit-messages.html) [said](https://github.com/erlang/otp/wiki/writing-good-commit-messages) [before](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/blob/30bce7/CONTRIBUTING.md#format-commit-messages).
  - From the seven rules of a great Git commit message:
    - 2. [Try for 50 characters, but consider 72 the hard limit](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#limit-50)
    - 7. [Use the body to explain what and why vs. how](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#why-not-how)

### Issue Labels and Milestones

Personal Guide

- For Issue Labels, see [labels.yml][labels]
- Milestones
  - **Current Tasks**: main milestone (*name could change based on a specific project, sprint, or month*)
  - **Next Tasks**
  - **Blue Sky**

            <li>Stuff we are doing right now: this is the “main” milestone. We give it a name (like Alpha 2 or Strawberry Rhubarb Pie) and we write down what we are trying to accomplish with the milestone. We create a new milestone when we are ready for the next iteration.</li>
            <li>Stuff we’ll probably do soon: this is a standing “**Next Tasks**” milestone. We never change or rename this milestone.</li>
                <ul><li>We use a permanent “Next Tasks” milestone (as opposed to renaming it to “Alpha 3” or actual-next-iteration milestone) because we don’t want to presume or default to including something in the real next iteration. When we’re ready to start planning the next iteration we’ll create a new milestone, and only deliberately move things into that milestone.</li></ul>
            <li>Stuff we probably won’t do soon: this is a standing “**Blue Sky**” milestone. We refer to these tickets and sometimes look through them, but they are easy to ignore, somewhat intentionally ignored.</li>
            <li>What aren’t we sure about?: issues with no milestone.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Label: “Needs Discussion” - (addressed in a triage meeting) - use liberally for either big or small tickets</li>
        <li>“It’s better to give people more power: it’s actually helpful if people can overreach because it is an opportunity to establish where the limits really are and what purpose those limits have”</li>
    </ul>
